# Welcome to YooshTN's GitHub Pages Site!
This will primarily serve as a test of how GitHub pages works in it's most rudimentary form. This is by no means meant to demonstrate a total proficiency with the platform, rather to experiment with what is possible while I work on my actual site in another private repository pending deployment. 

I'd like to eventually use [this template](https://html5up.net/spectral) created by someone far smarter then I think I am[^1]. The template looks like this:

### Github Pages Goals
- [ ] Serve as a portfolio for MySQL projects & Tableau visualizations
- [ ] Contain an "About Me" section with a headshot, bio, and work experience/resume
- [ ] Showcase some of my personal style!

[^1]: Not actually possible.
